I developed an AI-powered chatbot that overcomes the limitations of traditional bots by enabling contextual, human-like conversations. It uses OpenAIâ€™s API as the core engine, enhanced with LangChain for conversation memory, Chromadb for vector storage, and BetterShot for improving intent accuracy. One key advantage is that we can train the model using our own dataset, making it adaptable for specific business needs. Additionally, I integrated Google Search API for real-time information retrieval, making the chatbot more dynamic and intelligent.
